# Hypothesis-Testing on Cholestrol Level
Hypothesis Test 
This project aims to analyze the impact of a specific diet program on individuals' cholesterol levels over a period of six months. The analysis involves exploring the distribution of cholesterol levels before and after the diet program, assessing normality, calculating summary statistics, and conducting hypothesis testing to determine if there is a significant change in the population mean cholesterol level.
