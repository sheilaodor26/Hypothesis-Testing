# Hypothesis-Testing on Cholestrol Level
Hypothesis Test 
This project aims to analyze the impact of a specific diet program on individuals' cholesterol levels over a period of six months. The analysis involves exploring the distribution of cholesterol levels before and after the diet program, assessing normality, calculating summary statistics, and conducting hypothesis testing to determine if there is a significant change in the population mean cholesterol level.
# Data
Recently a cholesterol level experiment was conducted on some individuals. The results can be found in the CholestrolLevel.xlsx database.
Goal of Analysis
Previous analysis has shown that the population mean of the cholesterol level is 5.95 and the standard deviation is 0.897. The research team is trying to determine whether an individual’s cholesterol level has changed or not after applying a certain diet program properly for the past 6 months.
# Hypothesis Statement
Dependent Variable – Cholesterol Level

Independent Variable - Application of the diet program

If individuals follow the diet program properly for the pasts 6 months then their cholesterol levels will change significantly.
